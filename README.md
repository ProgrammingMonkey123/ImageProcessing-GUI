# A simple Matlab GUI for general image processing.
---
## Introduction
This is a simple Matlab GUI for general image processing. So far the things it can do including sharpening an image or improving the contrast of an image and other general image processing.

## Usage Overview
It has three windows as you can see. If you click the button "加载图片" you can load a image in the upper lefe window. So far it supports the format ".jpg",".png" and ".bmp". Then you can change the image as you want,the right window will show the result of your change. Once you are satisfied you can click the button "确定". Then the lower window will save you current changes and you can continue your work based on that.

## Examples
You can check some examples in images.
## Note
I finished this GUI a long times ago and rencently I find it and decide to push it into my github. Some details I don't remember. Because I pack it to creat a ".exe" it is not easy to change the codes. So there are some Chinese and some functions have strange names. I am very sorry and if you have any problems, feel free to rasie an issue.
